# GEMINI Analysis: Dotfiles Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains a set of "dotfiles" used to configure a macOS development environment. It automates the setup of the shell, command-line tools, GUI applications, and system settings. The goal is to create a consistent and productive development environment on any new Mac.

The primary technologies and tools used are:

*   **Shell:** Zsh, configured via `.zshrc`.
*   **Package Manager:** Homebrew, with packages defined in `Brewfile`.
*   **Zsh Plugin Manager:** Zgenom for managing Zsh plugins.
*   **Neovim Distribution:** AstroNvim, with a custom configuration.
*   **Prompt:** Starship cross-shell prompt.
*   **Terminal:** iTerm2, with custom color themes.
*   **Automation:** The setup process is automated with shell scripts (`deploy.sh` and `symlink.sh`).

## Setup and Installation

The main entry point for setting up the environment is the `deploy.sh` script.

To run the setup, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script will perform the following actions:

1.  **Install Homebrew:** If not already installed, it will install the Homebrew package manager.
2.  **Install iTerm2 Shell Integration:** Downloads the necessary script for iTerm2 integration.
3.  **Install Zgenom:** Clones the Zgenom repository for Zsh plugin management.
4.  **Apply macOS Defaults:** Runs the `.macos` script to apply custom system settings.
5.  **Install Packages:** Installs all command-line tools and GUI applications listed in the `Brewfile` using `brew bundle`.
6.  **Create Symbolic Links:** The `symlink.sh` script is called to create symbolic links for the configuration files (e.g., `.zshrc`, AstroNvim config) from the repository to the home directory.

## Key Components

### `.zshrc`

This is the main configuration file for the Zsh shell. It handles:

*   **Prompt:** Initializes the Starship prompt.
*   **iTerm2 Integration:** Sources the iTerm2 shell integration script.
*   **Plugin Management:** Uses `zgenom` to load various Zsh plugins for features like auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, and fuzzy tab completion.

### `Brewfile`

This file defines all the software to be installed via Homebrew. It is organized into:

*   **Core CLI Tools:** `git`, `zsh`, `tmux`, `neovim`, `starship`, `fzf`.
*   **AstroNvim Dependencies:** `lua-language-server`, `prettier`, `stylua`, `ripgrep`, `lazygit`.
*   **GUI Applications:** `iterm2`, `visual-studio-code`, `lm-studio`.
*   **Fonts:** `font-hack-nerd-font` for proper icon rendering in the terminal.

### `deploy.sh`

This is the master script for automating the setup of the dotfiles on a new machine. It ensures that all dependencies are installed and configurations are applied in the correct order.

### `symlink.sh`

This script creates symbolic links from the files in the repository to their corresponding locations in the user's home directory. This allows the configurations to be version-controlled in the git repository while being active in the system. It also includes a feature to back up any existing dotfiles before creating the symlinks.

### `.macos`

This script contains a series of `defaults write` commands to customize macOS settings for better productivity and user experience.

### `astronvim_user_config/`

This directory contains the user-specific configuration for AstroNvim, a popular Neovim distribution.

*   `init.lua`: The entry point for the AstroNvim configuration. It sets up `lazy.nvim`, the plugin manager.
*   `lua/`: This directory contains the core configuration files, split into `community.lua`, `lazy_setup.lua`, `polish.lua`, and a `plugins/` directory for plugin-specific settings.

### iTerm2 Theme

The repository includes theme files for the iTerm2 terminal:

*   `iterm2-theme.json`
*   `nord.itermcolors`

These can be imported into iTerm2's preferences to change the terminal's appearance.

## Development Conventions

This project is managed through a set of configuration files and shell scripts. There are no formal build or test processes. The primary convention is to keep the `Brewfile` and `.zshrc` updated with the desired tools and configurations, and to ensure the `deploy.sh` and `symlink.sh` scripts remain idempotent and robust.
